		<p>"Mr President, I would like to thank the Vice—President for his proposals. I think this is a very good step forward. It is not the first step, by the way, to creating the Digital Single Market, and I would like to bring our attention to the fact that, to create the Digital Single Market, we need to pass legislative acts. That is what we need to do, and therefore the Council – which I cannot see here – is an important partner to work with to create this Digital Single Market. What I can see at the moment is that, on the Telecoms Single Market, on the Network and Information Security Directive and on the Data Protection Regulation – all three of which are fundaments for building the next step of the digital single market – the Council is not coming along with general approaches, with positions, which are negotiable for us as a Parliament.</p>
		<p>So I think that we need to insist first of all on the adoption of these legislative acts and then proceed with further measures. I think that you have made some good points, but there needs to be clear legislation, concrete formulations, about what you mean – for example – on platform neutrality and on geo-blocking; that is not enough, please try to improve the concreteness of these proposals."</p>
