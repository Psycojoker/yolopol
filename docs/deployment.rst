Deployment on OpenShift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenShift is an Open-Source Platform-as-a-Service software by Red Hat. It is
also available in its hosted version known as "OpenShift Online" and the first
three websites ("gears") are free.

.. danger:: The following command stores the secret key in an environment
            variable. Environment variables are not secure on openshift since
            they are printed out by the git receive hook.

To deploy the website, use a command like::

    $ rhc app-create \
        python-2.7 \
        "http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/reflect?github=smarterclayton/openshift-redis-cart" \
        cron-1.4 \
        postgresql-9.2 \
        -n yourdomain \
        -a yourappname \
        -e DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32) \
        -e OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WSGI_APPLICATION=memopol/wsgi.py \
        --from-code https://github.com/political-memory/political_memory.git
        --no-git

This should deploy the website. Add the git remote openshift created for you,
you can see it with ``rhc app-show``, ie.::

    $ rhc app-show -a yourappname
    [snip]
    Git URL:         ssh://569f5cf500045f6a1839a0a4@yourappname-yourdomain.rhcloud.com/~/git/yourappname.git/
    Initial Git URL: https://github.com/political-memory/political_memory.git
    SSH:             569f5cf500045f6a1839a0a4@yourappname-yourdomain.rhcloud.com
    [snip]

    $ git remote add oo_yourappname ssh://569f5cf500045f6a1839a0a4@yourappname-yourdomain.rhcloud.com/~/git/yourappname.git/

If you want, set up a branch it should auto-deploy when pushed::

    $ rhc app-configure -a yourappname --deployment-branch openshift

Then, it'll auto-deploy on a receive hook when you push that branch, ie. with
``git push oo_yourappname openshift``. Else, you can always deploy a given git
ref as such::

    $ rhc app-deploy some_git_ref -a yourappname

To fill up the representatives database table, either wait for the cron script
to be executed, either do it manually::

    $ rhc ssh app-root/runtime/repo/.openshift/cron/daily/update_database -a yourappname

OpenShift is fun, login with ssh and look around if you're curious, you'll be
able to recreate your app without much effort if you break it anyway.
